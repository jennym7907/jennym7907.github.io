This week we learned about definitions and pair programming. Definitions are basically an easier way to create an exact copy of a previous
image coded by just typing a simple name bounded to the said image. I can see how using definitions can allow us to create multiple images 
for our game quickly without needing to type out the whole code over again. Pair programming was taught to us so we can have a quicker way
to code our video game and be able to solve a problem quickly. In pair programming it starts off with two people with different roles. The first person is called the "driver," who controls the keyboard and the mouse. The second person is called the "navigater," who thinks about
a problem that occurs within the code. The navigater is not allowed to touch the keyboard or the mouse but is also allowed to review the
documentation and check for errors. With this way of programming I can see how this is a much quicker and easier way to program and code 
things by combining two minds together to solve any obstacles, which will be very useful for creating our game. For my learning this week, 
I felt that it was more of a challenge to do the pair programming as I am used to working on my own and solving problems by myself so it 
was a but difficult to get accustomed to having help. But I did enjoy it as sometimes I am unable to solve a problem on my own and need
someone's help.
