This week we learned about image function contracts and new functions needed to code certain shapes to make our flags. One challenge for 
me was trying to figure out the way the image function was needed to be formed to allow two rectangles to be placed where I wanted them in
one larger rectangle. Another challenge that I am still facing is trying to figure out how to form a put-image function to allow an image 
to be within the image I already coded. I plan to solve that problem by using the bitmap/url function inside the put-image function on 
Monday and seeing how that will turn out.

        h2 {
            color: rgb(28, 128, 128);
        }  
        
        body {
            background-color: rgb(215, 196, 255);
        }
            
        </style>
