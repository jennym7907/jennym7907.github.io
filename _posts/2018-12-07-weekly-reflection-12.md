This week we were continuing a project from earlier in the year as a part 2. We are continuing part 2 of the flag project. I still
have yet to figure out the geometry of my flag, but I will try my best to figure that out. The flag that I will be prgramming is 
US flag. A challenge that I faced was trying to make my flag collage to scale. Another chalenge for me this week was making the 
actual collage as I found it difficult to cut the shapes of the stripes I wanted. I will face those challenges again and approach 
them differently by doing more research on the geometry of my flag and by starting off with a base layer for my flag collage. I 
will be overlapping layers of paper to make both my collage easier to make and to be easier to understand to program once I'm on 
the computer.
