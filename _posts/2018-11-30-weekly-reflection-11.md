This week we just did the computer science midterm exam and after the exam we were analyzing the questions and contradicting whether the 
questions were novice, apprentice, or practitioner. The question I decided today to analyze once we got the analysis of the exam was 
question 20 in the analysis packet. I chose this question because when I was taking the exam I was really confused on what answer choice 
to pick, either earth-weight or moon-weight. But during the exam I decided to pick moon-weight because my thinking was that moon-weight 
was the number the expression was answering and that moon-weight should be the best name for the expression. I believe that the question 
wasn't difficult but rather the wording of the questoin was confusing as it seems that for the most part, the test takers were most likely 
confused in what "variable name" meant. The statisticis of those who answered this question correctly was 23.6% and those who chose 
moon-weight was 56.6%. The answer to the question was earth-weight, the reason for this was that moon-weight was being calculated but 
earth-weight was being used in the expression and thus would be the "best variable name" for the changing part of the expression.
