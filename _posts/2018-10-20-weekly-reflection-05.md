This week we learned about image function contracts and new functions needed to code certain shapes to make our flags. One challenge for
me was trying to figure out the way the image function was need to be formed to allow two rectangles to be placed where I wanted them in
one larger rectangle. Another challenge that I am still facing is trying to figure out how to form a put-image function to allow an image 
to be within the image I already coded. I plan to solve that challenge by using the knowledge I gained when trying to figure out how to 
connect more than two images in one. And using that same thinking to put that image in my new coded image while using the function 
bitmap/url that I had just learned.

        h2 {
            color: rgb(28, 128, 128);
        }  
        
        body {
            background-color: rgb(215, 196, 255);
        }
            
        </style>
