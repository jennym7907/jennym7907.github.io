This week we mainly learned about values, fuctions and how they can compare to how a sentence is structured. It made me understand how to 
know if my code is wrong, as without values and functions a code will not work or make sense to the computer. Same goes with a sentence, 
without a noun and a verb your sentence will both not be a sentence and not make sense. We also learned the deifferences between the two. 
The next day we then learned about the importance about thinking about how clarifying questions would make a model question to code much 
more accurate, if given one. With the example of "A rocket blasts off. How could we model the situation? What else would you like to know?"
This warm up allowed us to think about the types of questions we had to make this "model" we would create in this situaiton more accurate.
