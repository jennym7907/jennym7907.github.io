I think that the class will soon become more interesting and harder as time goes by. I enjoy getting straight to work instead of postponing it for later time. I've so far learned the basics in creating a website and what goes into making one. My biggest challenge so far was trying to understand some of the steps required to make this website. 

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
