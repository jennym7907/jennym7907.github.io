This week although this is pretty late, I would like to apoligize to Mr. Allatta for that. Anyways my screenshot for my game that is placed below this blog post was a very tedious task to complete but in the end it was pretty fun. The steps to create my screenshot was that I first had to figure out how I wanted my game to be. Then once I knew what I wanted my game to be like, I then had to look for those specific characters for my game. But instead of getting any picture of the web I had to look for an image that ended as a png in order for it to be transparent and for it not to have a white block around it inside of my background. Once I finally got all the png pictures for my screenshot I then had to code their positions in the way I wanted them to look like. After that was done I then saved my final piece and added my screenshot to an image file to allow for my screenshot to be placed at the bottom of this blog post. Overall it was a fun exprience that I enjoyed a lot.
