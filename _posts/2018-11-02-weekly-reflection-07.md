This week has been slightly hectic for me as I have missed two classes and without having those two classes, it has been a little more 
difficult to be able to connect the new concepts I have been missing and the ones I already know. But I have been able to go by and use the other concepts that I know to help and solve the new obstacles Mr. Allatta has set for me. This week, one of the big concepts have been using contracts and definig function with them. We have learned more on design recipes and how computer science functions are similar to the ones in math. As computer science is a branch of mathematics. Having that in mind it has been easier to have things click in my head. Apart from that we have learned a new function called string-repeat, although I haven't learned or was present when we learned it's importance, I plan to ask for my peer's notes to help me or to try and figure out it's importance as class continues.
