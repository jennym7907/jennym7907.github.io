So far I am feeling like I am doing okay in class and I hope to become better. By understanding the content I am being taught 
in a more intellectual way. Right now we are going to learn more about computer languages. But we already tocuhed the surface
of the language racket (scheme). Lately my only challenge is being able to grasp onto the information given to me quickly. And if I don't 
take down notes, I will most likely forget everything I was taught at the moment. But anything other than that, I haven't had any struggles
and I have been able to understand what we are learning and I feel that I am able to continue at the same pace Mr. Allatta is going at, at
the moment.
