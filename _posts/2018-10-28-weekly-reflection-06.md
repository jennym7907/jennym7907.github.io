The semester so far from up to this point has been a big learning experience for me. I came into this classroom knowing very little about
coding as I did not learn it in thoughts of using it but in finishing my work for a program that I was in, so it never really stuck. But 
as I have been attending this class, old concepts from before have been connecting for me. I have also been able to see how every class 
and new function we learn have connected to one another, allowing us to be able to solve the new challenges Mr. Allata puts ahead of us. 
One connection that has helped me the most out of many are the circles of evaluation and the coding language racket. These two concepts 
help me a lot in figuring out how to solve a problem when coding. Whether it be 2 or more images in one or coding a simple definition 
function. In all, this semester up to now has been much more than just looking at codes and remembering them. And I look forward to 
continuing on with this class and seeing how more and more concepts will connect to the next.
