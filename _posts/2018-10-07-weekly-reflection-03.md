This week in computer science I feel like I am going to go through some struggles in our next project (flag project)> I feel this way 
because I will have to learn how to imput images and connect basic shapes together to create one image out of pure code for my flag. 
But other than that, this week we learned about how to use CSS to affect the style of our learning blogs. Which could be described as
font, font-family, color, size etc. We also learned/researched about the components in the style of an HTML file. Such as <ul> </ul>, 
<em> </em>,<footer> </footer> etc. Along with their meanings. We also learned about contracts in computer science. We learned how to 
make contracts for basic mathematical expressions and and contracts for basic shapes. Lately I haven't been feeling like I am struggling
with any of the material but I know that I will most likely struggle with this new project. And that soon class will be getting much more
into the complex world of computer science and coding. I am hoping to have a challenge that allows me to work my brain to be able to wrap 
around and retain the new information given to me. 


<style>
       
        h2 {
            color: rgb(28, 128, 128);
        }  
        
        body {
            background-color: rgb(215, 196, 255);
        }
            
        </style>
